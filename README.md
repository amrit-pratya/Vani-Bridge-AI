🚀 Project Overview

Vani-Bridge AI is an end-to-end multimodal generative AI ecosystem designed for the "Next Billion" regional Indian creators. Developed by team Bedrock Bharat for the AI for Bharat Hackathon, this platform bridges the gap between local ideas and professional digital content by automating the entire content lifecycle.

🛠️ The Problem
Small business owners and regional creators in India face a "Three-Step Barrier":


Creation Gap: Lack of professional design and copywriting skills.


Language Barrier: Difficulty creating content in polished English or formal regional dialects.


Management Overload: Limited time to manage and schedule posts across multiple platforms.

✨ Key Features

Multimodal Vernacular Input: Accepts raw product photos and voice notes in regional Indian languages/dialects.


AI Lifestyle Studio: Automatically enhances product images by placing them in culturally relevant, high-end backgrounds using Stable Diffusion XL.


Deep Vernacular Logic: Generates catchy marketing copy and hashtags in Hinglish and regional languages using Claude 3.5 Sonnet.


Vani-Scheduler: A "Zero-Friction" automated posting system that schedules and publishes content directly to Instagram, X, and LinkedIn.

🏗️ Technical Architecture
The project utilizes a 100% Serverless Event-Driven Architecture on AWS:


Amazon Bedrock: Powering image and text generation with Claude 3.5 and SDXL.


Amazon EventBridge Scheduler: Managing precise, time-based triggers for social media publishing.


AWS Step Functions: Orchestrating the complex, multimodal AI workflows.


Amazon Polly: Converting text scripts into natural-sounding speech with Indian accents.
